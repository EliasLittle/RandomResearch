#Images

I saw a thing on twitter and wanted to mess around with it. 

I think some of these designs are based off of bit fields so thats kinda what I named them. 

Really its just function defined patterns that are then turned into images and animations using the Images.jl package.

Some cool art and interesting visualizations.
